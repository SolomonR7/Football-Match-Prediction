# Football-Match-Prediction
Prediction of a match based on previous results
The proposed prediction technique uses perceptron neural network for its implementation. The neural network uses the data from previous meetings of these two teams to form a pattern and tries to predict the result of the given match.
We will be using the match played between Real Madrid and Barcelona in the last 11 years as an example.
